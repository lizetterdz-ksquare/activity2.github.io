    <h1 class="text-center">Valladolid, Yuc</h1>
    <p class="text-center">By Lizette Rodriguez</p>
    <article>
      <p> One of the oldest cities in the Yucatán peninsula and currently one of the two "Pueblos Mágicos" in the state. Valladolid is fascinating in all the extension of the word.
        Its -paradoxically peaceful and full of life at the same time- are home to several historical locations, casonas, museums, cozy hotels, farmer's markets, fountains, stores, 
        ice cream and traditional snack stops, parks and many corners to explore.

      <p> Its priviledged location has given it the title of "Capital of the Mayan East". Valladolid is right between two of the most important cities of the peninsula: Mérida and
        Cancún. Also, close by are located the principal archiological zones: Tulum, Ek Balam, Cobá and, one of the wonders of the world, Chichen Itzá.

    <p>Moving into the food, as a personal favorite I have the <em>lomitos</em>. They are a pork based meal. The meat is choped into square-like pieces and then slowly cooked with
      tomatos, lard and habanero chilis. They are typically served with refried beand and hard boiled eggs!</p>
